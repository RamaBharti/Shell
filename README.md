# Shell
The code implements a simple shell like the Linux bash shell.
The shell executes simple Linux commands and also implements commands like 'cd' and 'history', which are not directly available as Linux executables.
The shell operates in an infinite loop and process will be terminated when the user enters Ctrl+C.
